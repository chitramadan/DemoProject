Please Note Below points:

1) Create a service user "readservice" and give read permissions to it on the root directory, before testing this code.
2) This code has been developed and tested in AEM 6.2
3) I have added 2 custom component in the first parsys, apart from the other OOTB components asked for, for the testing purpose.
4) Site has been created using Geometrixx site, so you may find traces of Geometrixx in the content root pages.
5) AEM project has been created from Maven Archetype
6) Adding rte in multifiled was creating css issues and it was not getting rendered properly in multifield, which would require deep debugging of OOTB libraries and
might require customisation as well, so I have skipped that part for now and added textarea in multifield component.
7) Just to demonstrate the working of rte component, I have added the same in list children component instead of multifield component.
